# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** November 30, 2025

## 1. Introduction
This Privacy Policy applies to the **Lock In** Chrome extension. We value your privacy and are committed to protecting it. This policy explains how our extension handles your data.

## 2. Data Collection and Usage
**We do not collect, store, transmit, or sell your personal data.**

- **Local Storage:** All user settings, schedules, and lists of blocked sites are stored locally on your device using the Chrome Storage API (`chrome.storage.sync`). This data is synced across your own signed-in Chrome browsers by Google's infrastructure but is never accessible to us or any third parties.
- **Website Data:** The extension checks the URLs you visit locally within your browser to enforce your blocking rules. This information is processed entirely on your device and is **never** transmitted to external servers.

## 3. Third-Party Services
The extension does not use any third-party analytics, tracking services, or external databases. It operates entirely standalone.

## 4. Permissions
The extension requests the following permissions to function:
- **Storage:** To save your preferences locally.
- **Scripting / Host Permissions:** To technically enforce website blocking on the specific sites you choose to block.

## 6. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. We encourage you to review this page periodically for the latest information on our privacy practices.
